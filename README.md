## edge runner  
A Reactive native mobile application.       
Using github api V3. Currently the app is fetching User persional information as name , profile picture, email, following , followers , repositories and contribution details. In future version I am planning to use a github calender contribution chart.  The app also have the  ```dark``` and ```light``` mode feature.     
The App is live on expo store and in production mode.
