###### for Android   

> When building for android you can choose to build APK (expo build:android -t apk) or Android App Bundle (expo build:android -t app-bundle). App bundles are recommended, but you have to make sure the Google Play App Signing is enabled for your project, you can read more about it here.
The first time you build the project you will be asked whether you'd like to upload a keystore or have us handle it for you. If you don't know what a keystore is, you can have us generate one for you. Otherwise, feel free to upload your own.  

``` [exp] No currently active or previous builds for this project.```

```Would you like to upload a keystore or have us generate one for you?```
```If you don't know what this means, let us handle it! :)```

  ```1) Let Expo handle the process!```
  ```2) I want to upload my own keystore! ```
